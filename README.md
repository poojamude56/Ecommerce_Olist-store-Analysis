**Overview:**
The Olist Store Analysis project aims to analyze customer purchasing patterns and payment statistics on an E-commerce platform, Olist. This project covers several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as weekday vs weekend sales, payment statistics, delivery time, and customer behavior. The analysis is based on nine CSV files, which are cleaned and manipulated to extract valuable insights.

**Insights:**
Insights from this analysis can help in making business decisions, such as focusing on products that customers are interested in, improving product and service quality, and optimizing marketing in provinces with high total sales. In addition, this analysis also provides an overview of customer consumption trends and patterns that can be used to direct further business strategies.
